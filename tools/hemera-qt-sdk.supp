# QDBus doesn't call dbus_shutdown, so some D-Bus internal data structures are leaked.
# We never call any low-level dbus message creation functions ourselves - if there are leaks,
# they're either caused by not calling dbus_shutdown, QDBus bugs or libdbus bugs - neither of which
# are our problem.
